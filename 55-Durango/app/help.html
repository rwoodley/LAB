// following three.js conventions, the ship always looks now the Z axis
// it has a forward facing camera. So the camera === the ship. so we only need a camera to contain
// the orientation and position info of the ship. just need 1 object.

// the ship has velocity around its Y or X axis or both. X is horizontal axis, Y is vertical axis.
// positive rotation around X means pushing the up arrow.
// the ship always faces in the -z direction.
// The x and y velocity are angular velocities and do not affect the ships position until forward thrust is applied.

Up Arrow: Increase velocity on Y vector (green)
Down Arrow: Decrease velocity on Y vector

Left Arrow: Increase velocity on X vector (red)
Right Arrow: Decrease velocity on X vector

x - 
ctrl-x

y - 
ctrl-y

z - 
ctrl-z

Axes:
x - red
y - green
z - blue
-z - cyan. The camera looks down the cyan (-z) axis.
