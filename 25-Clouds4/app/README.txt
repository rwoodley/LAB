There are 2 separate experiments here:
Particles.html and Spheres.html

In both cases I call 'createCloud()' to generate some random vertices based on merged sphere geometries.

In particles I use these vertices to create particles with a smoke texture.

In Spheres.html I use a shader material to create some interesting lighting effects.

Neither of them look much like clouds however.
